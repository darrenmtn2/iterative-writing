## Invitation

I am working on a new project and I wonder if you’d be interested in participating. I would like to interview you in a GitHub file about your writing/learning process—and then make that part of a repo about iterative writing and thinking. It will eventually be a web book or magazine of some sort, maybe. Does that seem interesting?


## Interview questions

* How would you describe your writing process?
* What is the relationship between writing and editing?
* When did you decide it was important for you to learn to code or use Git?
* Where does most of your writing happen?
* How do you know when something is done? Does it matter?
* Do you ship something before it’s done?
* Do you edit things after they’re live? How do you decide?

## Meta questions

* What are the intentions of this project?
* What should learners know how to do?
* What questions should learners be able to answer?
* What kinds of activities will show learners how to develop those skills?

## Principles

* Collaboration
* Curiosity
* Not knowing
* Unfinished, unfolding universe
* Inherent value in information and experience
* Throwing ideas away is part of learning

## Shape

* Small posts
* Incremental changes, including additions, deletions, and editing (refactoring ideas)
* Fiddling leads to larger ideas and more stable pages or cards of ideas

## Past posts

* Baby Steps to Better Product Content
