# Allen Tan

Hey Allen! I’m curious about the relationship between writing and learning iteratively. I guess you could say this project is about Git too. Feel free to change the questions, or rearrange them. We’ll probably go back and forth 1–2 times in editing. Thanks!

## Where did you first start writing on the web?

## When did you learn to use Git? Why?

## Has Git influenced your writing process? How?

## Where do you do most of your writing? What other tools or tricks are involved?

## Describe your process for me. How do you know when something is ready to publish? When is it done?

## How do you decide when to work in public?
