# Allen Tan

N: Hey Allen! I’m curious about the relationship between writing and learning iteratively. I guess you could say this project is about Git too. Feel free to change the questions, or rearrange them. We’ll probably go back and forth 1–2 times in editing. Thanks!

A: Hi!

## When did you first start writing on the web?

I think it was sometime in middle school. I had a Xanga and a Livejournal, both set to private. (Well, they had a couple public posts to not raise suspicion but all the real content was private.) I wrote everything in Windows Notepad because I didn’t trust the web editor not to crash. God, that was terrible.

## When did you learn to use Git? Why?

I learned Git when I started working at Crush + Lovely. I was designing but also doing the markup and css, so I had to jump right into working on a team. At the time I only knew the bare minimum: pull, push, add, commit, and I learned typing into the command line based on what my coworkers told me over IM. (This is still how I learn to do things in Git.)

## Has Git influenced your writing process? How?

## Where do you do most of your writing? What other tools or tricks are involved?

## Describe your process for me. How do you know when something is ready to publish? When is it done?

How it begins varies a lot. Sometimes I work on little bits and fragments – putting together sentences that I like, jotting down comments on research – and then try to sew it up into some coherent order. It can take a while before I have enough pieces for a piece, and I have lots of orphans lying around waiting to be used. Other times I know exactly how a piece needs to go, I don’t really use outlines to map out structure but I see it in my head, and I just need to get it down.

Then I let drafts sit for a couple of days before looking at it. Sometimes I’ll share it privately with friends, especially if I know it’ll be something they have strong opinions about. That can be a great sanity-check: am I actually saying something that needs to be said? Does it make sense?

Once it gets out of its weird larval mutating alien phase, then I start doing passes to clean it up: swapping out words, rephrasing sentences, fixing grammar problems, removing extraneous parts. This is my favorite part of writing, it’s almost meditative to go through it over and over with a comb and shift letters around.

It’s done when I stop wanting to change it, I guess! When I put it up online and see the words in the layout, I can spot a lot of problems. When I fix them, it’s probably ready.

## How do you decide when to work in public?
