# Iterative Writing

## Introduction

This is the beginning of an online resource for people who believe in writing iteratively. I’m not sure what it will be yet, but that’s the magic of working in the open air.

This project is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
