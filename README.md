# Iterative Writing

## Introduction

This is the beginning of an online resource for people who write iteratively. I’m not sure what it will be yet, but that’s the magic of working in the open air.

This project is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), and will eventually have a website of some sort. If you’re interested in contributing an interview or want to see something added, feel free to send me a pull request or [open an issue](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/iterative-writing/issues). You can also email me: nicole at swellcontent.com.
