# Interviews

## Personal stories

* LiveJournal, Twitter, and Tumblr
* Developers

## Invitation

Something like this:

I am working on a new project and I wonder if you’d be interested in participating. I would like to interview you about your writing/learning process in a Markdown file—and include that in a repo about iterative writing and thinking. Does that seem interesting?

## Interview questions

* How would you describe your writing process?
* How do you see the relationship between writing and editing?
* Why did you decide to learn to use Git?
* Where do you do most of your writing?
* Which tools do you use?
* How do you know when something is done? Do you publish anything before it’s done?
* Do you edit things after they’re posted publicly? How do you decide?
