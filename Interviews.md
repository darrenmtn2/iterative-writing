# Interviews

## Personal stories

* LiveJournal, Twitter, and Tumblr
* Developers

## Invitation

Something like this:

I am working on a new project and I wonder if you’d be interested in participating. I would like to interview you about your writing/learning process in a Markdown file—and include that in a repo about iterative writing and thinking. It will eventually be a web book or magazine of some sort, maybe. Does that seem interesting?

## Interview questions

* How would you describe your writing process?
* What is the relationship between writing and editing?
* When did you decide it was important for you to learn to code or use Git?
* Where does most of your writing happen?
* How do you know when something is done? Does it matter?
* Do you ship something before it’s done?
* Do you edit things after they’re live? How do you decide?
