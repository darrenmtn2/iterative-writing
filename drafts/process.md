# Process

## Writing in private

Do the work and share it after itâ€™s polished.

1. Wait for inspiration to strike.
2. Do some research.
3. Take notes.
4. Make an outline.
5. Think and think and think.
6. Change the outline.
7. Write a rough draft.
8. Revise.
9. Proofread.
10. Publish.

Never touch the piece again, unless someone finds an embarassing error in it.

## Writing in public

Share the work as you go. No map necessary.

* Embrace the mess. Work in public despite your fear of looking foolish.
* Pay attention and take notes. Everything is an idea.
* Sync whenever you save.
* Assume things will make sense. Assume things will change.
* Think about why you care. Write that down too.
* Cut things when you feel like it. Fiddle.
* Find the patterns. Move things around. Add contrast.
* Invite other people to contribute. Listen to their ideas. Let them change things.
* Keep working toward the truth.
* Reread the work. Check your tone.
* Fix typos. Keep going.
* Gather possible paths and links. Publish those too.
* Change your mind. Learn something new. Put that in there.
* This never really ends, unless you want it to.

## Editing

Similar goals:

* Be clear.
* Be concise.
* Use simple words.
* Organize the information as you go.
* Trust the reader.
* Make useful connections.
