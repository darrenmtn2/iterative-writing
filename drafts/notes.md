# Notes

* I don’t know what I’m doing. It’s great.

## Meta questions

* What are the intentions of this project?
* What should learners know how to do?
* What questions should learners be able to answer?
* What kinds of activities will show learners how to develop those skills?
* Why does iterative writing matter?

## Principles

* Collaboration
* Curiosity
* Not knowing
* Unfinished, unfolding universe
* Inherent value in information and experience
* Shedding ideas is part of learning
* Design is a process of articulation

## Shape

* Small posts
* Incremental changes, including additions, deletions, and editing (refactoring ideas)
* Fiddling leads to larger ideas and more stable chunks, cards, or pages of ideas
* Something like an essay that keeps going

## Personal stories

* LiveJournal, Twitter, and Tumblr
* Developers
